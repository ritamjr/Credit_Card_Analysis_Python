# Credit_Card_Analysis_Python

Project Overviews
We aim to address the following key problems:

Customer Spending Patterns – Understanding how different factors (age, income, credit limit, etc.) impact total transactions.

Credit Utilization & Risk – Examining utilization ratios and delinquency risks to detect financial risks.

Revenue Contribution – Identifying top-performing and underperforming states based on revenue distribution.

Demographic Impact – Analyzing gender, income, and age group differences in financial behavior.

Card & Fee Analysis – Evaluating how different credit cards and fee structures affect customer behavior.

Financial Performance Overview – Summarizing key revenue, interest earnings, and customer satisfaction trends.



Conclusion

The analysis provides a detailed breakdown of customer spending behavior, credit utilization, and financial performance across different demographics. Key takeaways include:

Younger and middle-aged customers (26-45) are the most active in transactions.

Higher-income groups generally spend more but maintain low utilization ratios.

Credit limit does not always correlate with spending, but customers with lower limits tend to have higher utilization.

Gender-based spending patterns are relatively balanced but can inform marketing strategies.

Geographical differences in revenue highlight strong and weak performing states.

Profession and income level play significant roles in financial contribution.

Delinquency affects spending, with higher-risk customers contributing less.

Overall, the insights highlight opportunities for targeted marketing, risk management, and revenue growth strategies.
